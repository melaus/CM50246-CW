Introduction


EM

K-means
    Algorithm
        pick k points as starting points
        for each point, compute means for each point
        ...
    Properties
        Pros & Cons

Gaussian Mixture Model
    Algorithm
    Properties
        Pros & Cons

Results
(500, 10000)
Datasets: default * 3, 5 clusters * 3, 20 clusters * 3, 50 clusters * 3
- default dataset setup - compare output, iterations
- GMM - kmeans VS random initialisation

Further Work
- K-means++ utilises probs to init, gives better results, in fact, used by scikit-learn, MatLab - verify this

    Using the Code
